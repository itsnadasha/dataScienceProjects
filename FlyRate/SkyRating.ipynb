I just traveled from Toronto to Berlin and back with two kids (5 and 7yrs old). The stopover in Iceland breaks up the trip more evenly (two medium duration flights), which was better for us than one really long and one really short flight. Also, kids get priority boarding, free food on the flight, a bag of interesting activities (stickers, games), and the entertainment system has a whole kid section. On our way back from Berlin we missed our connection because of a severe thunderstorm in Berlin (It was bad! Heavy winds and rain, thunder and lighting. I'm glad we didn't have to take off in those conditions). Once we arrived in Iceland and our flight to Toronto had left, Icelandair rebooked us on a flight for the next day and put us in a 5-star hotel for the night, with taxi, dinner, breakfast and lunch paid for. Our room had a view of the ocean and we had some time to explore the spectacular Icelandic coast. I was worried that we'd have to spend the night on a hard bench on the airport, instead we were treated to an extra day of vacation on this amazing island! Thank you, Icelandair!!\",\n          \"  We had booked a flight with Tigerair Australia for our soccer team to fly out from Sydney to Melbourne on Friday the 6th March 2020 for a soccer tournament. This flight was booked on the 20th of February 2020. After checking in the day before, we received a message from Tigerair on Friday the 6th of March at 9:30 am informing us that our flight has been cancelled \\\"due to poor weather conditions\\\" and that they had put us on the next a available flight which was on Saturday the 7th of March at 3:40 pm. However, we had already booked our hotel for Friday and our first soccer match of the tournament was on Saturday 11 am. After calling their customer service, we were told that they could not do anything about it other than provide a flight credit valid for 6 months. They also told us that we will not be given a refund as they cannot control the poor weather conditions. We were forced to book a last minute flight on the same day (Friday 6th of March) costing us $400 one way with Virgin Australia Airlines. It is interesting to know that only Tigerair had cancelled their flights for that day and no other airline did. Very poor customer service and will not book with them ever again. I hope they go bankrupt and in liquidation. It is also interesting that Tiger Airways Australia is a wholly owned subsidiary of Virgin Australia. Something fishy was definitely going on as the weather was perfectly fine on that day (both in Sydney and Melbourne).\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n
